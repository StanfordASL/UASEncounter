# UASEncounter

Julia code that simulates an encounter between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an intruding aircraft. It also contains code that uses Approximate Dynamic Programming to solve the Markov Decision Process associated with controlling the UAV to avoid collision with the intruding aircraft.

This code was used to generate the results in the ICRA paper [TODO: cite paper].

The `sweep_lagrange.jl` script was used to generate the curves in the paper.

Much of this code is undocumented, and it is intended to be consulted if details in the paper need to be clarified, but there are no plans to maintain this code for future research. Contact github user zsunberg if you have questions.
