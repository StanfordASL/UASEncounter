Turning needs to go further 300, 450 600 800 1000
running Mar 23 0020 on cheonan
and trlcons needs to go further logspace(2,5,7)
running on cambridge Mar 23 0030

[X] check on results - essentially the same as expected
[X] why does insane not work as expected?
        because of little wrinkles in the value function
[X] why aren't collisions working!?
        because seeds were saved wrong! regenerating initial conditions
        checked
[ ] decide on final 10 deg results
        sweep D 150, 180, 200, 220, 240, 300, 500
        turning lambda 100, 200, 400, 550, 700
            started cheonan 3/22 4 pm
        trlzero lambda logspace(2,4,6)
        trlbounded lambda logspace(2,4,6)
        trl lambda logspace
[ ] generate final 10 deg results
[ ] make it so that we can reliably change the noise
[ ] start other noise simulations
[ ] generate policy and value figures

what the heck - that spreadsheet just keeps deleting my csv entries
running test with hrl bounded at 500 action
how can the bounded hrl cause more deviations than the unbounded static version?

static trl limited by 100 (0036 I think) does really well...
static trl with 0.0 bound somehow still changes behavior with D...
0006 is 500 bound
2335 is 1000 bound

Wed 18 Mar 2015 12:11:32 PM PDT
Big things left to do
1. Why aren't the static TRL points all on the Paretto frontier
2. Specific classes of cases where this performs better
3. Run with different noise values
4. Write

Wed 18 Mar 2015 10:40:45 AM PDT
Ripples definitely gone with 50k sims, probably also with 30k
extending the grid helps extend the curve - still bunching at the very end

[X] regenerate initial conditions
[X] run turning with tighter range of lambda
[X] run trl with larger action set

Tue 17 Mar 2015 05:01:26 PM PDT
[X] get rid of ripples
    [X] symmetry
    [X] try an individual value iteration run
[X] get rid of bunching
    [X] look at extent of conservative zone for high lambda
        looks like this is the problem

[X] find zeros bug
[X] Change to 500 ft NMAC
[X] symmetry
[X] expand grid
[X] start more limited box
[X] run turning a bunch

Mon 16 Mar 2015 10:36:36 PM PDT
Immediate questions:
1. Why are trl values all bunched up?
[X] decrease min lambda
2. Why is turning so bad
[X] look at individual sims
[ ] decrease min lambda

[X] change initial conditions

Sat 14 Mar 2015 04:18:16 PM PDT
"pixelation" in pd policy is perhaps because it is reading from random memory

First thing: fix delay time metric to not look at collisions

Things that I could focus on:
1. Post decision features
2. Finding a problem that things work well on
    Changing intruder initial conditions to not be so likely to hit (so that the static gets more false positives
    limiting the intruder grid
3. UCT
4. Making turning work

Sat 14 Mar 2015 11:13:18 AM PDT
turning error seemed to be out of memory

[X] add reward
[X] generate some states on the path
[X] only generate deviated states otherwise
[X] make something to view simulations

Sat 14 Mar 2015 09:08:17 AM PDT
results of sims last night trl Q values: 3x50k does not clean up
error in turning?

[X] check on turning error
[ ] add reward to pd policy evaluation!
[ ] check on "pixels" in collision zone in pd policy
[ ] think about pd features

running time - fine par, PD ~= 2330-2115 = 194
coarse par, Q ~= 0325-0040 = 285

bigger arena?

Fri 13 Mar 2015 11:58:22 PM PDT
result of sims tonight: trl does better in terms of delay - barely
still weird value - run 50k more!
starting turning sims with 3x50k at the end using Qvalues
starting trlmatch with 3x50k at the end

Weird - if I use -p 6 with coarse discretization, don't get very good processer utilization

Why is pd lower than being in the collision circle? because of weird feature interactions?
Because! it is near -lambda! in the circle, it might leave, so it is not actually as bad, lol
look at bertsekas
when evaluating the policy, need to take reward of action into account!!

Tomorrow:
examine results and see if smoother
try bigger arena?

Fri 13 Mar 2015 08:25:06 PM PDT
Turning now performs poorly, but does perform...
Still can't beat static trl

[X] make policy viewer for pd policies
[ ] look at some individual simulations
    [ ] sim plotter
[X] Re-parallelize
[X] plot the initial conditions
    [X] arrow plotter
[X] Test random sim

Things to try
[ ] increase arena size
[X] penalize deviation
[ ] decrease noise (this probably won't work)

sims I Started now use pd policies and penalize deviation

??? Turning policies still look really bad - increase simulations?
??? why does pd value function have values lower than in a collision
NOPE maybe the rng_seed_offset is causing some bias

Thu 12 Mar 2015 01:17:25 AM PDT
tested and fixed ic batch generation (I think)
why does turning still not work well? look at some encounters
really seems like pd might work

Wed 11 Mar 2015 03:56:45 AM PDT
morning
[ ] post-mortem on pinv - why is the batch not making it full rank
[ ] start pd sims

Mon 09 Mar 2015 09:33:10 PM PDT
turning is being rediculous. Why?

1. [ ] Looks like it might be something to do with the grid - introduce the DAMN snapping
2. [ ] post-decision state

Mon 09 Mar 2015 03:33:30 AM PDT
Seems like deviations might be causing a problem - try without

Sun 08 Mar 2015 05:48:39 PM PDT

[X] slog through presentation
[ ] Make a case for using post decision state [independent Q-value functions introduce paradoxical results: actions resulting in the same expected next state can have different values]
[X] run trl sweep with 100 150 200 230
[ ] run trl sweep with 100 150 200 250 300
[ ] implement post-decision policy
[ ] Look at why the acceleration causes so many diversions

TRL Lagrange sweep Mar 8 1812
D = 100, 150, 200, 300, 500
rr = 0.045
deviations = 7627
avg_delay = 6.27


Sun 08 Mar 2015 01:04:27 PM PDT
Not able to make .05 rr with 15 deg noise! See Mar 6 though - the static trl could make it
SWITCHING TO 10!
with 10 deg noise, trl makes 0.05 with lambda=1000
with 10 deg noise static trl makes 0.0495 with D = 230

This looks like the new baseline point for static trl is
D = 230
rr = 0.05
deviations = 6800
avg_delay = 5 (? adjusted for double counting)

[X] have bisect save everything
[X] change trl actions to go from 100 to 500
[X] run trl with lower lambda
[X] make sweep save periodically


Sat 07 Mar 2015 11:03:16 AM PST
[X] bisect with accel actions
    [X] generate no collision ics
    swept log from 1000 to 1e6. lowest rr was 0.0825 at lambda = 178k
    saved in data/first_lagrange_bisection.jld
[ ] look at trl policy
[X] bisect with trl actions

Fri 06 Mar 2015 10:17:50 PM PST
[X] generate ics that cause nmacs
[X] bisect the static TRL Parameter to achieve risk ratio
    with 500.0 min starting dist, 0.1 rr seems achievable, but anything less than 0.9 is not
    with 800.0 min starting dist 0.05 seems achievable
    D = 780 => rr=0.045 for 0.05 desired rr

RED FLAG: randomness doesn't seem to be working quite right
