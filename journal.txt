ran some tests with snap generation - doesn't fill the space very well... maybe need to generate one for each node at least
Phi size: 50k x 1882, Phi rank:1706
[ ] generate ics on all gridpoints, snap others
[ ] launch both versions
derive gradient descent

Sun 01 Mar 2015 11:53:21 PM PST
tomorrow
[X] test generation functions
[ ] look at some tests where turning wins

Sun 01 Mar 2015 12:05:55 AM PST
[X] write out reward function
[X] investigate gain
[ ] new cost function

Thu 26 Feb 2015 02:23:11 PM PST
[-] git
[-] rewrite features
[ ] extract and test policy vs accelerations and TRL

[X] get policy extraction working
[X] figure out how to save policies
    [X] a type that I can save in a file that represents a policy
    [X] a type that exists in memory
    [X] make_record, extract_record
[ ] run with flat grid with accel action
[ ] run with flat grid with trl actions
[ ] compare all three

[ ] fit kaelbling features in notebook

Wed 25 Feb 2015 09:43:47 AM PST
changed intruder noise to 15 deg from 5
it seems like now 50k simulations is taking ~100 seconds - why?

[X] notebook to demonstrate peaks problem to Marco
[ ] figure out how to save policies
[ ] test policy vs TRL
[ ] rewrite features module

Tue 24 Feb 2015 10:28:27 AM PST
with explicit garbage collection before matrix inversion 100k still uses swap: 260 seconds

Mon 23 Feb 2015 05:45:08 PM PST
no memory help, gc mod 50, 50k sims: 45 seconds 
memory help, gc free, 50k sims: 54 seconds
no memory help, gc free, 50k sims: 121 seconds

Mon 23 Feb 2015 03:54:37 PM PST
For tomorrow
[X] Memory
[ ] extract policy
[ ] Fit Kaelbling Features

[ ] Augment State with Deviation?

Fri 20 Feb 2015 11:24:30 AM PST
[X] Profile Sparse
[ ] Rework features for less allocation
    - 6 workers, 50 k simulations, delayed garbage collection mod 100 = ~45 seconds for simulation
        200 singular values, 85 seconds - matrix inversion ended up with NaNs?
        all singular values, killed after ~8 minutes
        200 singular values, tol = 0.1, 58 seconds - Nans
    [ ] First, run with svds to see if it even works with 50k
[X] refactor actions
[X] Try actions
[ ] extract policy
[ ] Fit Kaelbling Features
[ ] Try Gaussians

Thu 19 Feb 2015 06:52:44 PM PST
[X] refactor value iteration into module
[X] profile
[ ] refactor actions
[ ] extract policy

Wed 18 Feb 2015 05:33:52 PM PST
[ ] grid interpolations for both intruder and goal
[ ] ...

Sun 15 Feb 2015 11:49:10 PM PST
[X] exponential grid
[X] interact
[ ] lit feature justification
[X] homework!!!!

Sun 15 Feb 2015 08:42:00 PM PST
[/] Try with just linear features (no grid)
[X] Try with finer grid

Sun 15 Feb 2015 04:18:48 PM PST
[-] Try pinv instead of SVD

Sat 14 Feb 2015 11:24:20 PM PST
[-] Try moving intruder ?????
[ ] READ!!!

Sat 14 Feb 2015 03:39:28 PM PST
[X] try with intruder eliminated
[X] write brute force evaluator
[X] implement goal grid

Mon 26 Jan 2015 10:25:17 AM PST

[?] add explicit cost features
[ ] ProfileView
[ ] plot r

Fri 23 Jan 2015 01:42:29 PM PST

[ ] define typealias post-decision state
[ ] update decision equations
[ ] run iterations


Sat 10 Jan 2015 04:33:02 PM PST
[ ] define feature function
[ ] solve offline
[ ] run tests

How do I make sure the matrices are full rank?

Future
[ ] Expand TRL to include 

Other ideas
Try this with/without TRL

Tue 13 Jan 2015 12:28:31 AM PST
Junkins and Crassidis p 8
y = step_reward
